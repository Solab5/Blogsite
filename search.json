    "text": "Awesome deep learning\n\nYeah, I mean it “Awesome!”. Deep learning is the most awesome, exciting, and interesting stuff I feel every data scientist should brag about. When I started my data science journey, I thought Learning basic machine learning was all until I heard about things like neural networks, NLP, Computer vision, and so forth. I was so eager to learn how deep learning works. Along the journey, I realized every business or institution needs artificial intelligence in all their support systems other than staying in the comfort zone of traditional approaches to problem-solving and innovation.\n\nHowever, getting started can be hectic and overwhelming since resources are all over the web, and getting the right resources can be difficult unless you have someone already practicing it to guide you, else you can waste a lot of time without getting started.\nYou can imagine what I went through to get started. If you are passionate about deep learning and don’t know where to start, or maybe you’ve started but feel you aren’t understanding anything from some random YouTube videos or resources. This short article is meant for you. Allow me to share with you a few of the facts and resources you need to know about deep learning maybe you could consider making a decision you will never regret today. Deep learning has proved to be the best machine learning technique in different areas all over the world including areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Medicine, Biology, Image generation/enhancement, Recommendation systems, Playing games, Robotics, Other applications – financial and logistical forecasting; text-to-speech; much more.\nMany experts will say that to get started with deep learning, you need a lot of math, lots of data, lots of expensive computers, or maybe a Ph.D. Trust me anyone irrespective of any field can practice deep learning. As long as you have an internet connection, you can use many online platforms to run deep learning codes on any computer. A commonly used one is a google Collab notebook. For math, simple high school math is sufficient for anyone to get started. The required basic Linear algebra and calculus can be understood along the way.\nIf you’ve done some basic machine learning before, the approach to deep learning is almost the same. This however doesn’t imply that deep learning is only for those that have done machine learning before, I have seen experts that have progressed with deep learning minus prior machine learning experience. A critique of basic machine learning is that it mainly involves dealing with quantitative data, unlike most deep learning problems.\nDeep learning problems are mostly texts from the web, sound, pictures, and videos among others thus there is always a need to train models that can enable transforming input data into numeric. This is because computers can only understand numbers.\nAll these applications stipulate why every business or institution needs artificial intelligence in all their support systems other than staying in the comfort zone of traditional approaches to problem-solving and innovation. If this has motivated you, you can check on the following resources which I believe can be a very mounting stone for anyone that would like to embark on a new journey of deep learning.\n\nlink to deep learning for coders(by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger)\nlink to MIT course for deep learning(MIT)\nLink to Coursera deep learning course(by Andrew Ng)"

However this approach can work for any computer vision problem.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to implemenent an image classification model in just a few minutes, using entirely free resources!. We shall be using the fastai library A high framework library built on top of pytorch. Feel free to see the ducumentation here for more understanding.\nThe basic steps we’ll take are:\n\nUse DuckDuckGo to search for images of car, plane, train or bicycle photos.\nFine-tune a pretrained neural network to recognise the groups\nTry running this model on a picture of a plane and see if it works."

In fastai we can create that easily using a DataBlock, and view sample images from it:\n\ndls = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), \n    get_items=get_image_files, \n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]\n).dataloaders(path, bs=32)\n\ndls.show_batch(max_n=6)\n\n\n\n\nHere what each of the DataBlock parameters means:\nblocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\nThe inputs to our model are images, and the outputs are categories (in this case, “plane”, “car”, “train” or “bicycle”).\nget_items=get_image_files, \nTo find all the inputs to our model, run the get_image_files function (which returns a list of all image files in a path).\nsplitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\nSplit the data into training and validation sets randomly, using 20% of the data for the validation set.\nget_y=parent_label,\nThe labels (y values) is the name of the parent of each file (i.e. the name of the folder they’re in, which will be pane, car, train, or bicycle).\nitem_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]\nBefore training, resize each image to 192x192 pixels by “squishing” it (as opposed to cropping it).\nNow we’re ready to train our model. The fastest widely used computer vision model is resnet18. You can train this in a few minutes, even on a CPU! (On a GPU, it generally takes under 20 seconds…)\nfastai comes with a helpful fine_tune() method which automatically uses best practices for fine tuning a pre-trained model, so we’ll use that.\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(3)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:208: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15, please use 'weights' instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15.

In this case, the pretrained model was trained to recognise photos in imagenet, and widely-used computer vision dataset with images covering 1000 categories).\nAnd another interesting thing to look at when dealing with categorical target variables is that you can run a confusion matrix which gives you a visual representation and a sense on what classes are hard to predict. For our case, there is no time any class is being predicted wrongly which means that our model is performing very well.\n\ninterp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)\ninterp.plot_confusion_matrix()"

Thanks to deep learning, computers can now do many things which seemed impossible just a few years ago, including creating amazing artworks, and explaining jokes. It’s moving so fast that even experts in the field have trouble predicting how it’s going to impact society in the coming years.\nOne thing is clear – it’s important that we all do our best to understand this technology, because otherwise we’ll get left behind!"

We can use any loss function as long as it can be optimized. Remember at each step we compare the predicted value and then compare it with the actual value then used use stochastic gradient descent to make the parameters as better as possible.

By default, it takes the first column for the user, the second column for the item (here our movies), and the third column for the ratings. We need to change the value of item_name in our case to use the title instead of the IDs:\n\ndls = CollabDataLoaders.from_df(ratings, item_name='title', bs=64)\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      user\n      title\n      rating\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      542\n      My Left Foot (1989)\n      4\n    \n    \n      1\n      422\n      Event Horizon (1997)\n      3\n    \n    \n      2\n      311\n      African Queen, The (1951)\n      4\n    \n    \n      3\n      595\n      Face/Off (1997)\n      4\n    \n    \n      4\n      617\n      Evil Dead II (1987)\n      1\n    \n    \n      5\n      158\n      Jurassic Park (1993)\n      5\n    \n    \n      6\n      836\n      Chasing Amy (1997)\n      3\n    \n    \n      7\n      474\n      Emma (1996)\n      3\n    \n    \n      8\n      466\n      Jackie Chan's First Strike (1996)\n      3\n    \n    \n      9\n      554\n      Scream (1996)\n      3\n    \n  \n\n\n\nTo represent collaborative filtering in PyTorch we can’t just use the crosstab representation directly, especially if we want it to fit into our deep learning framework. We can represent our movie and user latent factor tables as simple matrices:\n\nn_users  = len(dls.classes['user'])\nn_movies = len(dls.classes['title'])\nn_factors = 5\n\nuser_factors = torch.randn(n_users, n_factors)\nmovie_factors = torch.randn(n_movies, n_factors)\n\nWe can check the shape to ensure everything is running perfect\n\nuser_factors.shape, movie_factors.shape\n\n(torch.Size([944, 5]), torch.Size([1665, 5]))\n\n\nTo calculate the result for a particular movie and user combination, we have to look up the index of the movie in our movie latent factor matrix and the index of the user in our user latent factor matrix; then we can do our dot product between the two latent factor vectors. But look up in an index is not an operation our deep learning models know how to do. They know how to do matrix products, and activation functions.\nFortunately, it turns out that we can represent look up in an index as a matrix product. The trick is to replace our indices with one-hot-encoded vectors."

You can try iterating more and changing the learning rate to see wether you can make this better. The wd stands for weight decay but most deeplearning practioners call it L2 regularization. So it’s better to understand such jargon since thats what most reseach papers use.\nActually we used pytorch’s embedding previously to initialize our parameters, we can decide not to do that and build our own. Let’s do that. We begin by creating a function that takes size as an argument and then returns a tensor if randomly initialized parameters.\n\ndef create_params(size):\n    return nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(*size).normal_(0, 0.01))\n\nWe can then pass in the function instead of pytorch’s embedding.\n\nclass DotProductBias(Module):\n    def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors, y_range=(0,5.5)):\n        self.user_factors = create_params([n_users, n_factors])\n        self.user_bias = create_params([n_users])\n        self.movie_factors = create_params([n_movies, n_factors])\n        self.movie_bias = create_params([n_movies])\n        self.y_range = y_range\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        users = self.user_factors[x[:,0]]\n        movies = self.movie_factors[x[:,1]]\n        res = (users*movies).sum(dim=1)\n        res += self.user_bias[x[:,0]] + self.movie_bias[x[:,1]]\n        return sigmoid_range(res, *self.y_range)\n\nLet’s train again.\n\nmodel = DotProductBias(n_users, n_movies, 50)\nlearn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=MSELossFlat())\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5, 5e-3, wd=0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.944513\n      0.958574\n      00:11\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.847001\n      0.873356\n      00:10\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.736139\n      0.838051\n      00:11\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.584478\n      0.821091\n      00:11\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.484529\n      0.821726\n      00:10\n    \n  \n\n\n\nAnd wow, it even looks a little bit better than using pytorch’s embedding. This shows you the power of doing things from scratch."

    "text": "Interpreting Embeddings and Biases\nTo be an expert deep learning practioner, you need to be able to interprete models, there are some insights you can’t get from the data till you first run the models. Forexample let’s try interpreting the bias. We are using argsort to sort the values in ascending order and return the first five indices of those values. When we index them onto the title class, we get their names and print them.\n\nmovie_bias = learn.model.movie_bias.squeeze()\nidxs = movie_bias.argsort()[:5]\n[dls.classes['title'][i] for i in idxs]\n\n['Children of the Corn: The Gathering (1996)',\n 'Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace (1996)',\n 'Robocop 3 (1993)',\n 'Home Alone 3 (1997)',\n 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)']\n\n\nThe interpretation for this is that let’s say Robocop in this list is an action movie (I am not sure of it being an action movie). People that like movies may not like it as well. This implys that this particular movie won’t be recommended to users.\nWe can do the same for those movies with a high bias by passing True to descending. This prints for us movies that are liked. Forexample say Titanic, a user might like it even if he or she doesn’t like romantic movies. So such a movie will be highly recommended for users to watch.\n\nidxs = movie_bias.argsort(descending=True)[:5]\n[dls.classes['title'][i] for i in idxs]\n\n['L.A. Confidential (1997)',\n 'Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)',\n \"Schindler's List (1993)\",\n 'Titanic (1997)',\n 'Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)']\n\n\nWe can also do an interpretation on the embeddings, we have 50 factors and representing them on a 2D graph isnot possible. We can use PCA to just reduce the factors two just two dimensions. Surprisingly similars will tend to be clustered near each other, this is something that we didnt program. We didnt even do any feature engineering but the model does this for us. And as I said, these are insights you cannot get from the data untill you run the models.\n\ng = ratings.groupby('title')['rating'].count()\ntop_movies = g.sort_values(ascending=False).index.values[:1000]\ntop_idxs = tensor([learn.dls.classes['title'].o2i[m] for m in top_movies])\nmovie_w = learn.model.movie_factors[top_idxs].cpu().detach()\nmovie_pca = movie_w.pca(3)\nfac0,fac1,fac2 = movie_pca.t()\nidxs = list(range(50))\nX = fac0[idxs]\nY = fac2[idxs]\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\nplt.scatter(X, Y)\nfor i, x, y in zip(top_movies[idxs], X, Y):\n    plt.text(x,y,i, color=np.random.rand(3)*0.7, fontsize=11)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAll this that we’ve written from from scratch can be done using a fastai’s framwork collab_learner. Let’s try it and see whether we get similar results."

    "text": "Early faulty detection in air quality sensors is of increasing importance in ensuring reliable and accurate air quality readings. These sensors play a critical role in monitoring the pollution levels in the atmosphere however, due to their exposure to harsh weather, it’s natural that they will face wear and may require periodical servicing. The devices are rarely monitored in most cases, particularly in Uganda. The objective of this research is to build a model for the early detection of faulty sensors for replacement and repair. Using the unsupervised learning approaches in particular K-means and PCA; we train a predictive model and later evaluate it for accuracy using a test dataset. From the cluster analysis, the research identified 3 clusters that are; the health state cluster, nearing fault state cluster, and the faulty state cluster. The research discovered that there is no significant difference in adopting PCA as a preprocessing step in using the K-means algorithm. The research further recommended other clustering methods to be used to compare the accuracy score. It also recommended using more attributes for PCA to be effective.\nDownload paper on Makerere University Dissertation repository here or research gate here"
